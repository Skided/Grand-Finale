# Grand-Finale
The Grand Finale of school and of israel education system of so called "cyber"

The Grand Finale is a whatsap clone that include chat system with multiple participents, video call with multiple participents, and hopefully a valid face detection ai(if Nevo will be kind enough to work on that junk) made from the worse technology you can find around including - bad coding, bad variables names, bad security and a lot more...

Please do not skid this project since it made by 2 dumb 17 y.o dont take it srsly man

but it can show u how good is the israeli "Hi-Tech"

Remember this is the worse project you can find around pls dont use it for any professional purposes its just an low quality clone of chat systems
